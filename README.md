# PatatapClone

Replica of Patatap for Practice

This project is for further practice in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
Additionally, this application incorporates Paper.js and Howler.js
libraries for practice leveraging external resources that have already
been built for public use. To use this application, simply clone/download
the repository, open `index.html`, and smash the letter keys on the keyboard
to your heart's content!
